# **Project_PBKDF2BruteForcer Mind Map**
## PBKDF2BruteForcer Project!

---
### Tasking at Hand
Create a tool to peform offline cracking of PBKDF2 SHA256 Hashes
---
### Initial Assumptions
Given the size of password lists, threading will need to be used.
---
### Basic Ideas
Ingest a password and a hash
Generate a Hash based on the password
Compare the Password and the Given Hash
---
### Question to Assumptions
Are there other variations of PBKDF2_SHA256 hashes?
    Answer: There are DJANGO formated hashes.

Can I build a way to modify a wordlist based on a ruleset (Similar to Hashcat)?
    Answer: Probably. But I can also use hashcat to build another word list using rulesets as well.

### Pseudo Coding - What will it look like?
